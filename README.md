<h3 align="center"><i>Carousal Slider with Custom Indicator</i></h3>

## About : 
* A Carousel Slider is a graphical user interface component that allows users to cycle through a series of items, typically images or cards, by swiping or clicking navigation controls.
* It's commonly used in mobile and web applications to display a collection of content in a compact and interactive way.
* Adding a custom indicator enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback on the current position within the carousel.


## Features : 
* Automatic Scrolling: The carousel can automatically cycle through items after a set interval, providing a dynamic and engaging experience without user interaction.
* Swipe Navigation: Users can manually navigate through items by swiping left or right on touch devices, offering intuitive control.
* Customizable Indicators: Indicators show the current position within the carousel. Custom indicators can be styled to match the application's design and provide clear visual feedback.
* Infinite Looping: The carousel can loop back to the beginning after reaching the end, creating a seamless experience.
* Responsive Design: The carousel adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
* Animation Effects: Transition effects, such as fading or sliding, can be applied to the items as they move, adding a polished look to the carousel.
* Thumbnail Navigation: Thumbnails of the items can be displayed as part of the navigation, allowing users to jump to a specific item quickly.
* Content Versatility: The carousel can display various types of content, including images, text, videos, or custom widgets.
* Pause on Hover: The automatic scrolling can pause when the user hovers over the carousel, providing time to view content in detail.
* Customization Options: Developers can customize the size, spacing, and styling of the items and indicators to fit the application's theme.

<h3 align="center"><i>Parallax Effect</i></h3>

## About : 
* The parallax effect is a visual phenomenon where objects closer to the viewer appear to move faster than objects that are further away.
* This effect is commonly used in web design, mobile applications, and video games to create an illusion of depth and provide a more engaging user experience.

## Features : 
* Depth Illusion: By making background elements move slower than foreground elements, the parallax effect creates a sense of depth in a 2D space.
* Engaging Visuals: The effect adds a dynamic layer to the design, making the user interface more interactive and visually appealing.
* Smooth Animations: To achieve a realistic effect, smooth and fluid animations are crucial. This typically involves easing functions and frame-by-frame updates.
* Scrolling Interaction: The parallax effect is often tied to the userâ€™s scrolling actions, where different layers move at different speeds based on the scroll position.
* Layering: Multiple layers are used, each moving at different speeds. Typically, the background layers move the slowest, while the foreground layers move the fastest.
* Responsiveness: The effect should be implemented in a way that it works smoothly across various devices and screen sizes.

## Packages Used :
* cupertino_icons: ^1.0.6
* carousel_slider: ^4.2.1
* provider: ^6.1.2
* video_player: ^2.8.6
